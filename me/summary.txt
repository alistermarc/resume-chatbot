Hey there. I'm Alister Marc Domilies A Chemical Engineer turned into an AI Engineer
My passion for mathematics and programming led me first to Data Analytics and later to Artificial Intelligence. I have strong experience across the full data lifecycle—from data engineering and analysis to modeling and deployment. My Master’s in AI allowed me to master the fundamentals of the field, and I’m now focusing on natural language processing, particularly on how large language models can drive impact for companies.
